The best way to learn machine learning is by designing and completing small projects.
# Hello World of Machine Learning
The best small project to start with on a new tool is the classification of iris flowers (e.g. the iris dataset:https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris).

This is a good project because it is so well understood.

1. Attributes are numeric so we have to figure out how to load and handle data.
2. It is a classification problem, allowing us to practice with perhaps an easier type of supervised learning algorithm.
3. It is a multi-class classification problem (multi-nominal) that may require some specialized handling.
4. It only has 4 attributes and 150 rows, meaning it is small and easily fits into memory (and a screen or A4 page).
5. All of the numeric attributes are in the same units and the same scale, not requiring any special scaling or transforms to get started.
